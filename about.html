                    Hello everyone. As a photographer, I am grateful for and cherish
                    the trust that is given to me capture a moment. The The opportunity to connect with people 
                    is what I love most about what I do and photography is something that makes this even more 
                    enjoyable. Although photos are the final product once a photography session is over, the 
                    experiences, connections and memories that are built allow the images to shine; the photographs 
                    become more of a keep sake of the experience that was had while the photos were being taken. 
                    My desire to create and capture visually beautiful images goes hand in hand with having an 
                    enjoyable experience behind the scenes; this is where the magic happens. When someone tells 
                    me that they don't photograph well or don't know what to do in front of the camera it's 
                    always heart warming to prove them wrong and allow them to discover how fabulous they really are. 
                    Whether building a portrait series as a visual artist or connecting with people for a portrait 
                    session, I ensure that I'm bringing my best self to a shoot so that I can bring out the best 
                    in whomever I'm photographing.
                    <br><br>
                    If you're interested in knowing more about a portrait session or a just because you're 
                    fabulous shoot,
